# Sky Intruders

This Greenfoot Project was created by Riddhi Lamba in February 2022.

It is a "Sky Intruders" game in which the player must navigate their character to defend their castle and defeat the dragon invaders.

Please check out the "Sky Intruders.gfar" file to play the game directly on Greenfoot, or the "Sky-Intruders" directory to access all the code and assets used to create the game.
